This is a finite difference time domain method solver for Maxwell's Equations, to simulate propagation through a
rectangular straight waveguide. It employs multithreading to enhance speed also provides a serial execution functions
to compare speedup. It is currently unfinished and has been replaced by new simulation in the main folder
