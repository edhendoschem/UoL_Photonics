This is a finite difference time domain method solver for Maxwell's Equations, featuring second order absorbing boundary
in 1D and 2D grids, also the ability to easily add Perfect electrical conductors (PEC) and dielectric structures and 
be able to choose from a variety of sources.

<b>Note:</b> the text files beginning with plot_script_  are GNUPLOT scripts used to quickly visualize the data
produced by the simulation
