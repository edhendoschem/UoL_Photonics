This is a finite difference time domain method solver for Maxwell's Equations, to simulate propagation through a
rectangular straight waveguide. It employs multithreading to enhance speed also provides a serial execution functions
to compare speedup and correctness.
<b>Currently unfinished</b>

### To do:
1. Fix the source
2. Check if PML layer is working properly
3. Add amplification
