This program will read the parameters in config.txt and calculate the first 100 modes of the transversal cross section
of a rectangular waveguide using Marcatili's method. The modes will start at 0,0 (fundamental mode).

It will create two folders:
- mode_data: will contain a .csv file with the mode information
- mode_graphs: Will create a plot of the intensity of the EM field (requires gnuplot installed and added to PATH)
