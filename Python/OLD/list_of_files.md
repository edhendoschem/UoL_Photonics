# Filename and description
## 0-Planar waveguide.ipynb		
Calculates the parameters of a planar waveguide, splits the domain in 4 equal parts and assigns each to a processing
thread. 

**Note:** This could have been solved orders of magnitude faster using numpy wihtout the need for parallel processing

##0-Planar-Rectangular waveguide 0.45.ipynb
Uses classes to solve planar waveguides and rectangular waveguides using Marcatili's method, provides a range of options
to customize plot output and also displays progress bars.
