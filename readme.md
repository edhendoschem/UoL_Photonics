#Leeds Photonic group files

## Introduction

This repository is organized by programming language, each folder contains a readme file that explains the use of
each of the programs in it and a folder named 'OLD'.

The 'OLD' folder, contains working versions of programs which were written when I was learning that particular language 
and therefore may be disorganized and/or difficult to read.
