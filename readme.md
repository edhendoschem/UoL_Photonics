#Leeds Photonic group files

## Purpose and organization

This repository was created to share the knowledge with the rest of the Leeds Photonics group.

It is organized by programming language, each folder contains a readme file that explains the use of
each of the programs, and a folder named 'OLD'.

The 'OLD' folder, contains versions of programs which were written when I was learning that particular language, 
and therefore may be disorganized and/or difficult to read but they work! and could prove useful

If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know at pm14ehds@leeds.ac.uk

**Note:** If you find logical errors and/or bugs in the code, please let me know and I'll strive to fix it as soon
as possible!

**Note2:** Let me know if you find any spelling and grammatical error.
